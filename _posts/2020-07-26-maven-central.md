title: Publishing a Gradle project to Maven Central
date: 2020-07-26 19:00:00 +0900
---

I had some free time over the last few days to work on a small Java project, which I ultimately
decided to publish on Maven Central. Due to being unable to find up-to-date samples for Gradle
projects, I decided to collect my findings as a blog post.

While publishing projects to something like *npm* is fairly simple, uploading to Maven Central is a
bit more involved, as they have much stricter requirements and validation.

This blog post will guide you step by step from a plain Gradle configuration to being able to
publish JARs to Maven Central in no time.

### üë∂ Baby steps

#### Create a Sonatype account
Before we start, you need to gain write access to the repositories. Visit [Sonatype's Jira][jira],
create an account, and [open a new ticket][new-ticket] to claim your desired `groupId`.

If the group ID is an ordinary domain, you will need to prove ownership. In my case, to claim
`io.kream`, I had to add a `TXT` record referencing the ticket to my domain's DNS configuration.
For reference, [here's my ticket][sample-ticket].

As this is a manual process done by a Sonatype employee, the approval can take up to a few hours.
Once the account is approved, you'll be able to log in to the [Nexus Repository Manager][nexus],
along with the repository URLs you should use.

While we're waiting, let's configure the rest!

#### Generate a GPG key
To be able to sign the published artifacts, you'll need a GPG key. For step-by-step instructions,
you can refer to [GitHub documentation][gpg], but the process is as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
# Make sure to generate a 4096-bit RSA key.
gpg --full-generate-key
# The first line contains your key ID, right after "sec rsa4096/".
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
# Publish the key so other developers can verify your signature.
gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu --send-keys <KEY_ID>
# Export your secret key to a file.
gpg --export-secret-key <KEY_ID> > secret.gpg
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure to store the `secret.gpg` file in a secure place and save the key ID for later.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring Gradle
First things first, let's add the [`maven-publish`][maven-publish] and [`signing`][signing]
plugins to `build.gradle`.

{% highlight gradle %}
plugins {
  id 'maven-publish'
  id 'signing'
}
{% endhighlight %}

As stated in the [requirements][requirements], we need to include source and Javadoc JARs in the
published package.

{% highlight gradle %}
java {
  withJavadocJar()
  withSourcesJar()
}
{% endhighlight %}

Upon running `gradle build`, the `build/libs` directory should contain two additional JAR files,
ending with `-javadoc` and `-sources`.

#### Metadata
Since projects published to Maven Central require a `pom.xml` file, we'll have to generate one.
For the `maven-publish` plugin to do its magic, we need to define a publication and the target
repository:

{% highlight gradle %}
publishing {
  publications {
    jar(MavenPublication) {
      // Include JAR files.
      from components.java

      pom {
        name = 'project'
        description = 'The best project ever'
        url = 'https://example.com/project'
        licenses {
          license {
            name = 'MIT License'
            url = 'https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT'
          }
        }
        developers {
          developer {
            name = 'Me'
            email = 'me@example.com'
          }
        }
        scm {
          connection = 'scm:git:git://github.com/me/project.git'
          developerConnection = 'scm:git:ssh://github.com:me/project.git'
          url = 'https://github.com/me/project'
        }
      }
    }
  }

  repositories {
    maven {
      url = version.endsWith('-SNAPSHOT')
            ? 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots'
            : 'https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2'

      credentials {
        username project.findProperty('ossrh.username')
        password project.findProperty('ossrh.password')
      }
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The entry names can be anything, but we've chosen `jar` as the publication and `maven` as the
repository. All available properties for the `pom` section can be found [here][maven-pom].

You can inspect the generated `pom.xml` file by running `gradle generatePomFileForJarPublication`
and opening `build/publications/jar/pom-default.xml`. It will include the project information, all
the specified properties, and the dependencies.

As for the `repositories` section, we've specified the snapshot and release URLs, as instructed in
the Jira ticket. This way we can publish any number of `SNAPSHOT` versions before making the final
release.

You can specify your credentials in `$HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

{% highlight properties %}
ossrh.username=<USERNAME>
ossrh.password=<PASSWORD>
{% endhighlight %}

To avoid storing your password as plaintext, you can generate a user token from your profile page
on [Nexus Repository Manager][nexus].

#### Signing

Unlike *npm*, all files published to Maven Central need to be signed with GPG. With the `signing`
plugin, this is as simple as adding the following section to `build.gradle`:

{% highlight gradle %}
signing {
  sign publishing.publications.jar
}
{% endhighlight %}

Again, let's store the credentials in `gradle.properties`:

{% highlight properties %}
# Last 8 symbols of the key.
signing.keyId=<KEY_ID>
signing.password=<PASSWORD>
signing.secretKeyRingFile=/path/to/secret.gpg
{% endhighlight %}

There are other ways to retrieve this information from environment variables or `gpg-agent`.
For details, please refer to the [plugin documentation][signing].

You can verify the configuration by running `gradle signJarPublication` or just `gradle sign`.
If everything is in order, the command will complete successfully. Additionally, the `build/libs`
directory will now contain `.asc` files for the individual artifacts.

### ‚≠ê Release!
Now that everything is set up, you can run `gradle publish`, and in about 30 seconds, your project
should be published to the Sonatype repository!

If you're publishing a `SNAPSHOT` version, you're all done, but if you're trying to publish a
release version, we have to do some more manual work. Log in to [Nexus Repository Manager][nexus]
and click on `Staging Repositories` on the left.

This page will list your recently published staging versions. The repository should be in *Open*
state, which means it's waiting for your review. You can inspect the repository contents, and once
you're happy with it, click on the `Close` button. This will close the repository and trigger the
validation checks.

![Close the repository](/assets/images/close-repository.png)

This process can take a few seconds, but hopefully, all checks pass. If everything is in order, you
can click on the `Release` button and the package will be copied from staging to the release
repository.

Since this is your first time publishing to Maven Central, you must comment on your Jira ticket that
you've promoted the release, so the Sonatype employee can enable syncing. Once enabled, your project
should be available for download from Maven Central fairly soon, and on search engines in about two
hours.

Enjoy working on your project! üéâ
